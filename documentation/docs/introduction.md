This documentation is a work in progress. Any feedback is welcome!

`graphql-ppx` provides simple GraphQL primitives to the ReasonML and OCaml
programming language[^1]. If you are using GraphQL with ReasonML, you are
probably using this preprocessor extension.

Most probably the best way to get started is by following the documentation of
the [GraphQL client](clients.md) you are going to be using.

This documentation is for people who want to dive deeper into the functionality
of GraphQL ppx.

[^1]:
  While the GraphQL ppx works on both ReasonML and OCaml the examples in this
  documentation will be in ReasonML. If you are an OCaml user and interested to
  contribute OCaml examples, this would be great. You can write a pull-request.
